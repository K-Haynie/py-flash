# py-flash
This is a personal project, an attempt to create a simple flashcards app in Python.
The main branch is a stable and early form of the app in PyQt5; in order to get rid of a resizing issue I upgraded to PyQt6. Thus, the PyQt6 branch is the next (mostly) stable release with a greatly upgraded GUI.
