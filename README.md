# py-flash
PyQt-based Flashcards App

This is a personal project, an attempt to create a simple flashcards app in Python. It supports deck creation with a spreadsheet for question/answer pairs, animated card flipping, .csv or .tsv file imports, user preferences, timed and reverse practice modes, and the ability to display decks of cards by user-created collections. 

The master branch houses the most recent version of Flashcard Whiz (which runs on PyQt6.0.0). The prototype code is housed in branch pyqt5, and an older version of the gui is housed in the newgui branch.
